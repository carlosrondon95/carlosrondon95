# 👋 Hey! I'm Carlos Rondón

Cross-platform application developer focused on building useful, elegant and thoughtful digital products.  
I enjoy working with intention, paying attention to the user experience, and approaching every project with a mix of creativity, structure and strong personal criteria.

I'm also passionate about music — especially the vinyl world — and I love blending both of my universes: technology and sound.
